# Introduction

Runescape is an MMORPG that was released in 2001. Written in Java, it was attractive to users because
it could just run in their browser. In the last few years, this is no longer the case, and in order to
play Runescape, users must now install a client to play the game properly.

## Equipment and List of Materials

The things you will need to install and play Runescape are:
1. A computer capable of running the client. The requirements are listed here: https://github-wiki-see.page/m/runelite/runelite/wiki/GPU-FAQ
